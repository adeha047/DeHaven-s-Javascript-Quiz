# DeHaven-s-Javascript-Quiz
I created the HTML, Javascript and CSS to create a dynamically designed quiz. 
I added questions with a start button and next button
I used buttons in my html and CSS styling to display the page. 
I then added Javascript to loop through my questions 
I added local storage to account for the answers given by the user. 
I then created text to display the score received by the user. 
I created a timer to begin once the Start button is clicked. 
It will disappear once it ticks down to 0 
It will also disappear if the game ends before the clock ticks down.
